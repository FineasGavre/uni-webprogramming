## PHP, AJAX, JSON — WIP ⚙️

In this lab you will have to develop a server-side web application in PHP. The web application has to manipulate a Mysql database with 1 to 3 tables and should implement the following base operations on these tables: select, insert, delete, update. Also the web application must use AJAX for getting data asynchronously from the web server and the web application should contain at least 5 web pages (client-side html or server-side php).

For the database, you can use the mysql database on www.scs.ubbcluj.ro. On this myql server you have an account, a password and a database, all identical to your username and password on the SCS network. 

Write a web application for managing a multimedia file collection. The application should maintain various information about a multimedia file in the database (i.e. title, format type, genre, path in the file system etc.). The application should implement: multimedia file browsing (use AJAX for retrieving titles from a specific category/genre), adding, removing, updating a multimedia file from the collection. The files themselves does not have to be stored in the database. Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. category/genre), should be displayed (do this in javascript).
